Continuing heavy showers have caused landslides and led to the sinking of a portion of NH 39, creating immense hardship to the people residing here. NH 39, the lifeline of the two northeastern states, connects Manipur with Assam via Nagaland.  If the monsoon showers continue with the same intensity, it is expected that the sunken portion of the highway will have to be closed as it has already become difficult for vehicles to pass through the place.  The main concern of the administrative authorities is the landslide area at the old Kohima Municipal Council (KMC) dumping site about 7 km away from the state capital where mudslides have started with the arrival of the monsoon, leading to disruption of vehicular traffic. Passengers travelling between Kohima and Dimapur have also complained that it is already taking hours to reach their destination.

Traffic police diverted vehicles onto byways to ensure the Margao-Panaji route was still accessible. No casualties were reported. S V Parni, station officer, fire and emergencies services, Verna, told STOI, ""By afternoon, traffic on the NH 17 could move at a snail's pace. By evening the road was cleared."" At about 4:30am, a portion of the hill came crashing onto the highway near the Toyota Showroom. Incessant heavy showers over the last few days had loosened the soil, said sources. Fire services personnel immediately put three JCBs to work on cutting the fallen rocks and boulders. The rubble was then carted away by trucks. Parni said, ""After the JCBs completed the work, the Verna station's fire tender was used to wash the mud off the road. This was done to avoid accidents."" The tender made four trips and used about 18,000 litres of water, he added.
